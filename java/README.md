# Taurus

Taurus is a Command-Line program written in Java which facilitates the analysis and creation of cryptocurrency trading data.

## Description

The program works by querying the [Binance RESTful API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/) for financial information
such as exchange information containing details about currently-trading trade pairs such as ETHBTC, 24-hour price change statistics
and dated recent trade details including trade prices, quantities and quotes. Thereafter, this data is either output to the terminal
or used to create additional data such as establishing all trade paths between two given assets. Moreover, users are able to
save data retrieved from the API to JSON files and load the very same data into ```Taurus``` for later analysis.

## Getting Started

2. Open a new terminal window in the directory where the archive was downloaded
3. Unzip the archive using the following command to obtain the ```taurus-master``` directory:

4. Delete ```taurus-master.zip``` using the following command:
```
rm taurus-master.zip
```
5. Change into the ```taurus-master/java``` directory by executing the following command:
```
cd taurus-master/java
```

### Compilation

* To compile ```Taurus.java```, enter the following:
```
javac -cp .:json-20200518.jar Taurus.java
```

### Execution

```

#### Report

* To execute ```Taurus.java``` in Report, execute the following:
```
java -cp .:json-20200518.jar Taurus -r <asset filename>.json <trade filename>.json
```

where ```<asset filename>``` and ```<trade filename>``` are both JSON files containing exchange information and trade details regarding a particular trade pair, respectively. 

```<asset filename>``` is obtained by running ```Taurus.java``` in Interactive. Upon program startup, at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Interactive Menu```, enter ```1```.

Exit the program by entering ```0``` at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Asset Details Menu``` and ```0``` at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Interactive Menu```.

```<trade filename>``` is obtained by running ```Taurus.java``` in Interactive. Upon program startup, at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Interactive Menu```, enter ```6```. Then, at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Trade Overview Menu```, enter ```2```. At the ```Base Asset Symbol:``` prompt enter a crypto-currency of your choosing (e.g. ```ETH```), then at the ```Quote Asset Symbol:``` prompt enter another crypto-currency of your choosing (e.g. ```BTC```) and, finally, at the ```Number of results to return:``` prompt enter the number of recent trades you would like to view. Afterwards, at the ```Selection:``` prompt of ```Trade Overview Menu``` enter ```4```.
